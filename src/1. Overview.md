<span style="color: orange;">IMPORTANT SOLANA GLOSSARY:</span>

- Account:
  A record in the Solana ledger that either holds data or is an executable program. An account is addressable by a key, often referred to as a public key or pubkey.

- App:
  A front-end application that interacts with a Solana cluster.

- Client:
  A computer program that accesses the Solan server network cluster.

- Program:
  Onchain program / smart contract.

- Onchain programmer:
  The executable code on Solana blockchain that interprets the 'instructions' sent inside of each 'transaction' to read and modify accounts over which it has control. These programs are often referred to as "smart contracts" on other blockchains.

- Instructions:
  A call to invoke a specific instruction handler in a program. An instruction also specifies which accounts it wants to read or modify, and additional data that serves as auxiliary input to the 'instruction handler'. A 'client' must include at least one instruction in a 'transaction', and all instructions must complete for the transaction to be considered successful.
