Users of blockchain each have a keypair (private key & public key)

<span style="color: orange;">Good to Know:</span> private keys are used to sign transactions which proves that you initiated a transaction while your public key is an address where people can go to for transactions with you, and also prove that you made a transaction.

Is an address with a small balance of 'Sol'. Users can interact with a Solana smart contract using sol. For example, a user's private key can be instructed to sign a transaction on the Solana blockchain, then transfer the Sol using the system program's transfer function, and then write a note about the transaction using the system's memo program's memo function (of the smart contract, maybe? or perhaps of the Solana blockchain). These steps are called instructions.
