What is blockchain and what can you do with it?

<span style="color: orange;">What Blockchain Is:</span>

A distributed database that

- is a ledger
- is stored in multiple locations around the world
- has no central authority
- and directly transacted

<span style="color: orange;">Good to Know 1</span>: A block is a bundle of transactions.

<span style="color: orange;">Good to Know 2:</span> Blockchain uses digital signatures for peer to peer digital verification - it contains information about a transaction like the currency used, time of transaction, and state of transaction (which lets you know whether or not the transaction is successful).

Solana lets you perform fast secure payments in any currency such as Bitcoin.

<span style="color: orange;">What a Smart Contract Is:</span>

- They are programs that run on blockchain as its hosting service or cloud provider

- Smart contracts are like APIs invoked by instructions instead of HTTP requests.

- Smart contracts write changes out to the blockchain as an effect just like an api gives reponses as an effect of being used.

- Smart contracts extend blockchain beyond simple payments, such as, lending money without a bank, exchanging items directly with each other, create lottery without a lottery issuer, e.t.c
