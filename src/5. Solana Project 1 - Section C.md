<h3>Your First Taste of a Solana Program</h3>

Now let's look at a complete code for our program that saves a user's favorite to the blockchain. If you read [Project 1 - Code File](Project%201%20-%20Code%20File.md), then you already have a good idea what most of the code herein is doing:

```rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
declare_id!("");

pub const ANCHOR_DESCRIMINATOR_SIZE: usize = 8;


// 'Favorites' is what we what to save to the Blockchain
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Favorites {
    pub number: u64,

    #[max_len(50)] // (50) as in 50 bytes
    pub color: String,

    #[max_len(5, 50)]
    pub hobbies: Vec<String>,
}

// this struct holds every meta data needed for a successful 'set_favorites' action - the destination account to add a favorite to, the signer (instruction runner), & the system_program
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SetFavorites<'info> {

    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,

    // An act account for all favorites set per user of our 'set_favorites' instruction handler
    #[account(
        init_if_needed,
        payer = user,
        space = ANCHOR_DESCRIMINATOR_SIZE + Favorites::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [b"favorites", user.key().as_ref()], // a PDA used to give a non-user account (e.g, favorites) an address on the Blockchain
        bump // Used to calculate the seed provided above
    )]
    pub favorites: Account<'info, Favorites>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}


#[program]
pub mod favorites {

    use super::*;

    // Now function 'set_favorites()' would take instructions provided by clients, run them, and then save the results to the Blockchain
    pub fn set_favorites(context: Context<SetFavorites>,
        number: u64,
        color: String,
        hobbies: Vec<String>
    ) -> Result<()> {

        let user_public_key = context.accounts.user.key();

        msg!("Greetings from {}", context.program_id);

        msg!("User {}'s favorite number is: {number}, favorite color is: {color}, and hobbies are: {hobbies:?}", user_public_key);

        // this is the code line that actually writes a new favorite into the favorites account
        context.accounts.favorites.set_inner(
            Favorites {
                number,
                color,
                hobbies,
            }
        );

        Ok(())
    }

}
```

Now click on the 'Build' button inside the Solana Explorer.

Upon building the project, you should click on 'Deploy'.

When you do attempt to deploy though, you will be prompted about two things:

- Whether or not to save a `keypair`. Note that you do not have to. You can simply click the `Continue` button.

- Secondly, your low balance of `sol`. You will be asked to choose whether or not to request for an airdrop (as in, acquirefree dev-net `sol`) from inside the Solana Explorer command-prompt. For now, type and enter `no` into the command line.

You can actually request for an airdrop from the Solana explorer. You need to first click on your devnet address which opens a new browser tab to the Solana Explorer website. Next copy your `Address`, and head over to [https://faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com), paste your copied address into the `Wallet Address` input, choose an `Amount` (preferably, 5), and then click the `Confirm Airdrop` button. You should see a prompt that says "Airdrop was successful!".

Now go back to the Solana Playground, and click on the `Deploy` button. After a successful transaction, go back to your Wallet page on the Solana Explorer, scroll down to your `Transaction History`, and click the refresh button to see the transaction history with the latest transaction updates.

You can search for your Solana account on the blockchain by copying your program's account `id` inside the macro `declare_id!()` and pasting it into the Solana Explorer search bar as a search query.

For visuals on how to deploy this Solana program using the Solana Explorer , watch the bootcamp course video from [30:21 - 32:50].

---

Your Solana explorer link to request for an airdrop would vary depending on your `declare_id!()` value. For example, let's say your `declare_id!()` value is `ww9C83noARSQVBnqmCUmaVdbJjmiwcV9j2LkXYMoUCV`, then, your appropriate Solana explorer link would then be - https://explorer.solana.com/address/ww9C83noARSQVBnqmCUmaVdbJjmiwcV9j2LkXYMoUCV?cluster=devnet
