<h3>Add Blinks and Actions to'votingdapp' Developed Earlier</h3>

#### Preparing the 'votingdapp' project for adding Blinks and Actions:

On this page, we'll add blinks and actions to our previously created `votingdapp` project, and there is a lot of different amount of work that we'd have to do for blinks and actions. We will be referencing the [Solana Actions and Blinks documentation page](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions) to prepare our `votingdapp` project for adding Blinks and Actions to it.

<span style="color: orange;">1</span>

#### Deploy your dapp (e.g, 'votingdapp'):

In the previous chapter ('Project 2: Voting Application'), we used `anchor-bankrun` to run tests in the [Testing Dapps](10.%20Testing%20Dapps.md) page. However, in this chapter, we will need the local test validator to test our dapp that has some UI bootstrap on top of it.

Let us first go into our `anchor` folder and perfom an Anchor deploy operation. Now this might be different based off your Solana config, so actually, you might need to check your Solana config first with - `$ solana config get`. We need to set our config environment to local (RPC URL: http://localhost:8999).

Set your Solana config environment to local if it isn't already set to local:

```bash
solana config set -ul
```

Now we can run the anchor deployment command:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

The above command will deploy your dapp project's binary, e.g, `votingdapp.so`. to the blockchain.

If `$: anchor deploy` fails to work with an error message <span style="color: #722f37; font-size: 12; font-weight: 600;">error sending request for url (http://127.0.01;8099): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)</span>, then it means that your 'solana-test-validator' is not running. You can fix the error by just running `$: solana-test-validator` to start the 'solana-test-validator' which is a requirement to deploy your anchor smart contract locally. Upon starting the 'solana-test-validator', retry the `$: anchor deploy` command.

Check your successfully deployed program at [https://explorer.solana.com/](https://explorer.solana.com/) - switch from `Mainnet Beta` to `Custom RPC URL`, then copy, paste, and enter the `Program Id` displayed on your terminal into the search bar that has a placeholder text that says - <small style="font-size: 14.5px; letter-spacing: 0.25px;">Search for blocks, accounts, transactions, programs, and tokens</small>.

After successfully deploying your dapp to the local validator (using `solana-test-validator`), and searching for your dapps's `Program Id` on [explorer.solana.com](explorer.solana.com), you should see something somewhat similar to the following:

![Screenshot of explorer.solana.com votingdapp Program Id search](./assets/explorer.solana.com-votingdapp-Program-Id-search-result.png 'Result of the search for our votingdapp Program Id on Solana Explorer')

<span style="color: orange;">Good to know 1:</span>

The `solana-test-validator` command when run for the first time, creates a new folder called `test-ledger` inside the working directory where the command is run. If you delete this folder and re-run the command, the folder will simply be recreated.

<span style="color: orange;">2</span>

#### Install @solana/actions:

Go into your project's root directory. If you currently inside the `anchor` directory, then you have to `$ cd ..` so you can be inside your project's root directory. Use the command below to install `@solana/actions`:

NPM:

```bash
npm install @solana/actions
```

<br/>

<span style="color: orange;">3</span>

#### Run your dapp

Let us now run our `votingdapp` in dev mode:

```
npm run dev
```

<span style="color: orange;">4</span>

#### Create a GET request to get the right information to do our Actions:

We need to structure our request in such a way that follows the guidelines specified in the Solana Actions documentation page' URL schema here - [https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions#url-scheme](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions#url-scheme).

- We will write the URL Schema for our Actions inside a `route.ts` code-file located at - `web` - `app` - `api`. For you, the right folder may be `src` - `app` - `api`. Create a new sub-folder named `votingdapp` inside the `api` folder. Please note that in the bootcamp's video, the new folder was named `voting` instead of `votingdapp`.

- Now copy the `route.ts` code file inside `.../api/hello` into our previous created new `.../api/votingdapp` sub-folder. The copied `route.ts` files should have the following content:

```ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
	return new Response('Hello, from API!');
}
```

- You can check out the newly created route by opening `localhost:3000/api/votingdapp`. You will find the text `Hello, from API!` written on your screen.

The template we have chosen to build our dapp from spins up a basic NextJS server-side app for working with blinks, which should be noted to be quite a heavy application for these blinks. NextJS server side is quite heavy for this for this usage. It is recommended to use a Node JS server - like an Express server if you can. But because we have a scaffold and we will later on in the course build the actual frontend for the voting application, we are just going to use this backend and bootstrap it with this voting action.

<span style="color: orange;">5</span>

#### Return valuable information in order to display the blink on any social media

The expected metadata response after an Action client makes a GET request to an Action provider for its available Actions is a JSON body-payload that follows the specification of `ActionGetResponse`:

```ts
export type ActionType = 'action' | 'completed';

export type ActionGetResponse = Action<'action'>;

export interface Action<T extends ActionType> {
	/** type of Action to present to the user */
	type: T;
	/** image url that represents the source of the action request */
	icon: string;
	/** describes the source of the action request */
	title: string;
	/** brief summary of the action to be performed */
	description: string;
	/** button text rendered to the user */
	label: string;
	/** UI state for the button being rendered to the user */
	disabled?: boolean;
	links?: {
		/** list of related Actions a user could perform */
		actions: LinkedAction[];
	};
	/** non-fatal error message to be displayed to the user */
	error?: ActionError;
}
```

Fields `icon`, `title`, `description`, and `label` are required. The remaining fields are optional. We will also need to provide CORS information. For now our `api/votingdapp`'s `route.ts` now looks like this:

```ts
import { ActionGetResponse } from '@solana/actions';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
	const actionMetadata: ActionGetResponse = {
		icon: 'https://zestfulkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Peanut-butter_hero_for-web-2.jpg',
		title: 'Vote for your favorite type of peanut butter!',
		description: 'Vote between crunchy and smooth peanut butter',
		label: 'Vote',
	};
	return Response.json(actionMetadata);
}
```

You can test your blinks using the [dial.to](dial.to) website. To use `dial.to` to test your blinks, you'd include the localhost link to your blink within the `dial.to` route, similar to this - `https://dial.to/?action=solana-action:http://localhost:3000/api/<your-blink-here>`. Make sure to avoid CORS related errors. Read the [step 6](#check-out-your-blink-visually-using-dialto-and-fix-cors-errors) to know exactly how to prevent CORS-related errors that prevent your blinks from loading when testing blinks.

<span style="color: orange;">6</span>

#### Check out your blink visually using dial.to, and fix CORS errors

In our case, we can use the `dial.to` website to have a visual representation of what our blink looks like by using the this specific link - `https://dial.to/?action=solana-action:http://localhost:3000/api/votingdapp`. Upon visiting this link, you'd realise that the blink actually fails to load and is thus, blank. That's because we are yet to fix CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) requirement that your browser has in place to keep you safe online.

![dial.to Blink CORS error screenshot](./assets/dial.to-blink-cors-error-screenshot.png 'https://dial.to blink CORS error')

Let's fix the error by modifying our `api/votingdapp/route.ts` file:

```ts
import { ActionGetResponse } from '@solana/actions';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
	const actionMetadata: ActionGetResponse = {
		icon: 'https://zestfulkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Peanut-butter_hero_for-web-2.jpg',
		title: 'Vote for your favorite type of peanut butter!',
		description: 'Vote between crunchy and smooth peanut butter',
		label: 'Vote',
	};
	return Response.json(actionMetadata);
}
```

Upon doing the above modifications, our action can now be served by a blink, and if you check our the link to our blink using the appropriate `dial.to` link to our blink, our blink should now load.

You would get a warning that your blink is not yet registered, and that's okay for us since we are just testing to make sure it works how we want it to for now. The warning is there to let you know blinks that are known by a blink registry. Using an unknown blink is done at your own risk.

![Loaded but partially finished blink](./assets/loaded-but-partially-finished-blink.png 'Dial.to warning that our blink is yet to be registered')

<span style="color: orange;">Good to know 4:</span>

Part of the whole system for onboarding blinks as of the time of the bootcamp 2024, onto social-media, is that you have to actually get your action registered via some kind of registry out there, e.g Dialect.
