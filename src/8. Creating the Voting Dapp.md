<h3>Find Out How to Create a Solana App Quickly from an Official Template</h3>

Do the following in the order listed:

<span style="color: orange;">1.</span> Inside your `WSL` terminal, `cd` or `mkdir` the directory of your choice for the project. In my case it looks like this `/home/<my-user-name>/solana-bootcamp/bootcamp-temp`.

<span style="color: orange;">2.</span> Run an npx command to create a new Solana app using a ready-made template:

```bash
npx create-solana-dapp
```

<b>Please Note:</b>

If you asked for permission to install for example `create-solana-dapp@4.1.0`, simply press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard to proceed.

In the Solana bootcamp, the name of the app was - `voting-dapp`, the selected framework was - `Next.js`, the selected template was - `next-tailwind-counter (Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Anchor Counter Example)`.

--it takes a while to install via npm, so now might be the right time to go have some snack or distract yourself with something else.

<span style="color: orange;">3.</span> Cd in to the `voting-dapp`, and run the npm installation command (you can use npm locally):

```bash
npm i
```

On my WSL (2) installation on my Windows 10 machine, `Installing via npm` never completes (I don't know I didn't stick around beyond 3 hours to find out if it would still finish the install). If that is the case for you too, don't panic, simple cancel the installation and do the following:

- Install a lower version of Node using nvm:

```bash
nvm install 23.0.0
```

- Downgrade to a lower version of npm:

```bash
npm install npm@9.7.1 -g
```

- Use Node version 23.0.0 (although you may find that nvm already uses this version especially if you have just installed it):

```bash
nvm use 23.0.0
```

- Optionally exit out of WSL, re-open it, and cd into the directory containing your project. For me, my project's cd command was `$: cd ../../../../home/<my-user-name>/solana-github/bootcamp-temp/voting-dapp`

<span style="color: orange;">4.</span> Run the now installed `voting-dapp` using npm with command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Please note that if you had probelems with your project and had to tweak your Node and nmp versions, please note that it would best for you to delete your existing `voting-app`, and re-create another one, and then cd into it, and run `$: npm run dev`.

Also note that the `voting-dapp` will run at `localhost:3000` by default. Feel free to check it out.

<span style="color: orange;">5.</span> Run the Solana `Testnet` validator toolchain using command:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

Note that the Solana `Testnet` validator will run at port '8899' (`http://127.0.0.1:8899`) by default.

<h3>Good to Know:</h3>

You can check out `http://127.0.0.1:8899` and click on the button right next to your `Select Wallet` button that says `devnet` and then click on `local` from the drop-down. Optionally click on the `Account` menu to see information about the amount of Sol that you have locally. If you have followed this guide up till now, there will be no account to display. We'll do that soon.

You can also use the Solana Explorer website [https://explorer.solana.com](https://explorer.solana.com) to look at everything that is happening on your local Validator. Simply click on the green button on the webpage that says `Mainnet Beta`, and then choose `Custom RPC URL` from the drop-down options.
