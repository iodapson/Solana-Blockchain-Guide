<h2>Solana In A Lean Wrap</h2>

This is a compressed version of [Solana Blockchain Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amAq-WHAFs8) powered by the programming language, [Rust](https:///www.rust-lang.org/learn) and TypeScript.

This book focuses more on the concepts to get things done. It does not cover Solana-specific concepts in detail. Rather, it extracts and sometimes annotates Solana concepts necessary to become a very proficient Solana developer

You can use it a quick reference material, in complement with the official Solana documentation for a more detailed Solana concepts explainer.

### Conventions Used

- Wherever you see `{{_}}`, it represents a placeholder text for an actual value, variable, or expression. The text inside the position of `_` should be used or changed in-place of `{{_}}`.
  For example, if you see `{{my_chosen_value_name}}`, it should be replaced with `your_chosen_value_name`.

### Solana Examples

- You can find concrete examples of Solana mini-apps from the official documentation on [Solana Official Docs Page](https://solana.com/docs) for Solana.
  _Enjoy!_
