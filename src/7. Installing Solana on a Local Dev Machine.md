<b>Getting Started:</b>

For references, please visit the Anchor Installation webpage here - [https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)

Please note that if you're on Windows, it is recommended that you install WSL2 for your local development.

1. Install Rust [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. Next up, please follow the installation instruction for [Solana Installation here](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation). And just in case you encounter the error `error: linker 'cc' not found` or `error: could not exec the linker cc = note: Permission denied (os error 13)` in the process of following this guide to install anchor on your Linux system, then first run this command to fix this error;

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev libssl-dev
```

<b>Important Notice:</b>
Please note that immediately after you have installed Anchor, but right before you use Yarn to create a new Anchor project, you should verify that the `PATH` enviroment variable was set up correctly by running command

```bash
which anchor
```

Your output from running the bash command above should look similar to `/home/user/.cargo/bin/anchor`. If the command fails or the output is empty, make sure to add the `~/.cargo/bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable. Since this guide assumes you are using a bash terminal on WSL2, the command to use will be:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For more information about other terminals (e.g Fish, and Zsh), check the bottom section of this [Anchor Installation page](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation). You may also want to follow the Generating Shell Completions guide on the page.

<b>Moving On...</b>
If you would like to add the avm binary to your path (recommended), then please apply the following command, replacing `<your-user-name-here>` with your actual user name:

```bash
export PATH="/home/<your-user-name-here>/.avm/bin:$PATH"
```

Then to confirm that the avm binary has been added to your PATH, run command:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

---

Now you can resume following the [Solana Installation here](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation) to create a new Solana project using Yarn.

<h4>WSL Information:</h4>

Please note that if you are a Windows user, you need to be using WSL2 instead of WSL1. To verify the version of WSL that you are using, please run the following command on your `Windows Powershell`:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

The Solana installation guide recommends that you use NVM (Node Virtual Manager), and guess what, if you try to install NVM on WSL1, NVM would recommend that you use WSL2. Read the rest of this section

To upgrade from WSL1 to WSL2, you need to:

- Enable the virtual machine optional component used by WSL 2, and Download the Linux kernel update package. Use this link to find out how you can do both - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-3---enable-virtual-machine-feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-3---enable-virtual-machine-feature). Please, remember to upgrade your WSL from inside Windows Powershell using command - `wsl --set-version <distro name> 2` after enabling the virtual machine optional componsnet used by WSL 2, and downloading the Linux kernel update package.

For more information on how to Upgrade WSL version from WSL 1 to WSL 2, review the section of this page - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2)

For more information on how to Enable Virtual Machine Feature and Download the Linux kernel update package, then review Step 3 and Step 4 of this page - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-3---enable-virtual-machine-feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-3---enable-virtual-machine-feature)

<!--<h4>Hold On..</h4>

Provided that you have been following the installation guide here - [https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation), please note that you don't have any need to run command `$ anchor build` just yet. You also do not yet need to follow the remainder of the installation guide, specifically the section on [Solana CLI Basics](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#solana-cli-basics). Why? You see, Solana has `Testnet`, `Devnet`, and `Mainnet` and this course starts out with just the `Testnet`, but the Solana CLI Basics section of the Solana Installation guide would get you configurations for Solana `Mainnet` for your machine. Right now you only need to deal with Solana `Testnet`. No worries we'll come around to start dealing with the `Devnet` and `Mainnet` sooner or later as you work your way through the bootcamp.-->

Congratulations! Now you are good to go to create awesome Solana projects.
