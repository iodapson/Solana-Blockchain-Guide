<h3>Let's first address the design to understand what we need to do conceptually.</h3>

<br/>

#### Its Design Specification

![Screenshot of the Voting Dapp's Design Specification](./assets/The-Votingdapp-Design-Specification.png 'The Voting Dapp Design Specification diagramatic explanation')

- In the illustration above, we have two accounts - `Poll` and `Candidate`, and for each account we've specified the data we want stored inside it on the right-hand side of the screen, so for example, for Account `Poll`, we want to store - `poll_id`, `description`, `poll_start`, `poll_end`, and `candidate_amount`.
- Whereas, for Account `Candidate`, we want to store - `candidate_name` and `candidate_amount`.
- On the left-hand side of each Account, we specify the seed we want to use, so for example, for Account `Poll`, we use `poll_id` as its seeds, wherease for Account `Candidate`, we use `poll_id` + `candidate_name` as its seeds.
- Finally, we have a set of Instructions namely; `Initialize_Poll`, `Initialize_Candidate`, and `Vote`.

#### Its Code:

Before looking at the code for the `votingdapp`, it is recommended that you review the [Solana Teaser Page](Solana%20Program%20teaser.md) especially if you unfamiliar with writing Solana smart contracts. Interestingly, you may gain better understanding of the code below by also reading the next page - [Testing Dapps](10.%20Testing%20Dapps.md) side-by-side with the code.

Please note that it is known convention accross the Solana Dev community to name an `Account` provided as context (`Context`) for an instruction-function the same name as the instruction function itself. For example, if you have an instruction-function named `initialize_goodies`, then by convention, the function's `Account`-`context` is expected to be named `InitializeGoodies`.
